# Water Consumption
My name is Elham and I am working on this data set to determine the water consumption over 40 years and how it changes based
on the city population to get a pattern.
The data set includes 40 rows and 4 columns; Year(from 1976 to 2019), New york city population, NYC consumption(million gallons per day), Per capita(Gallons Per person per year) and it is taken from NYCOpenData
Here is the link of the data set;
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m
Also I included the Python script in the repository to show how I analyz the data set and get answers for questions that stakeholders are seeking.
